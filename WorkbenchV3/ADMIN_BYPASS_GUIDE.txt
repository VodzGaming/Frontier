FRONTIER WORKBENCH — ADMIN BYPASS CONFIG
---------------------------------------

1. Runtime file location
   - Created automatically at first server start: `$profile:/Frontier/WorkbenchAdminBypass.json`
   - Same directory as `WorkbenchPower.json`. Deleting the file regenerates it with a sample entry.

2. JSON structure
```
{
    "adminSteamIds": [
        "76561198000000000"
    ]
}
```
   - Keep the values wrapped in quotes.
   - Use raw Steam64 IDs only (no names, commas between entries).
   - You can put as many entries as you want; order does not matter.

3. Finding a Steam64 ID
   - Ask the player to run `status` in-game and copy the long numeric ID.
   - Or paste their profile link at https://steamid.io and use the “steamID64” value.

4. Effect in game
   - Anyone listed can open/craft/refresh every Frontier Workbench regardless of its per-bench authorization list.
   - Bench owners still have full control even if not listed.
   - Changes take effect on the next config reload (restart the server or delete `WorkbenchAdminBypass.json` to regenerate).
